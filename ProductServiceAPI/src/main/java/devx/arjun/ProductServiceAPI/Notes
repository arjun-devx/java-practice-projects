Calling 3rd Party APIs

1. Write the mechanism to call - getALLProduct and getProductById APIs on fakeStore
2. Create our own APIs, to get all products and getProductById which will internally call fakeStore and show the data


CLIENT <-> ProductService <-> FakeStoreAPI

controller -> contains the APIs
service -> contains the business logic
repository -> talks to DBs, does CRUD
model -> contains the schema
client -> classes that will talk to other services


ProductService -> FakeStore Service
FakeStoreClient -> Contains the code to communicate with FakeStore


Spring ->
RestTemplate -> going to be deprecated || use RestTemplate - library
WebClient -> latest


------------------
Cardinality among the models

Product

Category



Product
        Category category;

Category

        List<Product> product;


Maintain version in the API URL --> /something/v1/something/
Whenever we change the API Contract -> we should also change the URL
We change the versions in the url v1 -> v2
new url -> /something/v2/something

API contract -> How to use the API, the inputs required and the output structure
