Calling 3rd Party APIs

1. Write the mechanism to call - getALLProduct and getProductById APIs on fakeStore
2. Create our own APIs, to get all products and getProductById which will internally call fakeStore and show the data


CLIENT <-> ProductService <-> FakeStoreAPI

controller -> contains the APIs
service -> contains the business logic
repository -> talks to DBs, does CRUD
model -> contains the schema
client -> classes that will talk to other services


ProductService -> FakeStore Service
FakeStoreClient -> Contains the code to communicate with FakeStore


Spring ->
RestTemplate -> going to be deprecated || use RestTemplate - library
WebClient -> latest
